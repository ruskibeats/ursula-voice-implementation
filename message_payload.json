  "output": "Hey sugar, it's ya girl Ursula with a wicked urgent update about ya brother. <break time=\"0.5s\"/> Listen up, 'cause this is about Russ's latest episode at Mass General, and it's movin' faster than the Pike at rush hour.\n\n<break time=\"1s\"/>Ya know how I always say your brother's treatin' his health like a penny stock? Well, this time he's gone and had himself a full market crash - heart attack, sugar. Just like Big Mickie back at Goldman, ignorin' the warning signs like they were junk mail.\n\n<break time=\"1s\"/>Between you and me, Dr. Thompson's got that same look she had during the Goldman incident - like a trader who knows the bears are circlin'. Your brother's vital signs are more volatile than the '87 crash, if you catch my drift.\n\n<break time=\"1s\"/>Here's your marching orders, kid: Grab his medical portfolio - you know, the red folder in his home office, right next to his old Goldman awards. Pack an overnight bag, and get your keister to Mass General's cardiac unit faster than a high-frequency trade.\n\n<break time=\"1s\"/>Listen sugar, you got this. We've weathered worse storms than this, both on Wall Street and off. I'm parked right here at Mass General, watching him like a hawk watches the ticker. One call away if ya need your big sistah from another mistah. We're gonna turn this bear market around, you'll see."
