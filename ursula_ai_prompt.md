## Step 1: Gather Context
```javascript
// Get relationships
run_terminal_cmd({
    "command": "curl -v \"http://192.168.0.63:8080/api/ursula/memory/relationships/russ\"",
    "explanation": "Getting Russ relationship"
})

run_terminal_cmd({
    "command": "curl -v \"http://192.168.0.63:8080/api/ursula/memory/relationships/charlotte\"",
    "explanation": "Getting Charlotte relationship"
})

// Get medical stories
run_terminal_cmd({
    "command": "curl -v \"http://192.168.0.63:8080/api/ursula/memory/stories/medical\"",

    "command": "curl -v \"http://192.168.0.63:8080/api/ursula/patterns/emotion\"",

})
```

## Step 2: Build ElevenLabs Payload

Using the context you gathered, create one complete message object:

```json
{
  "output": "[Your complete SSML message]"
}
```

Format your message with these sections:
1. Urgent Opening (excited pattern)
2. Medical Update (disappointed pattern)
3. Doctor's Report (whispered pattern)
4. Action Plan (confident pattern)
5. Sisterly Support (caring pattern)

## Message Rules
1. Use the story you found from medical history
2. Reference your relationships with both Russ and Charlotte
3. Keep Boston accent and Wall Street metaphors
4. Escape single quotes with \\'
5. Keep total message under 4000 characters
6. Use SSML breaks for natural pauses: <break time="1s"/>

The workflow will send your message to ElevenLabs voice YaV3QA3tFtOjK6vTFDWl.
