They thought she was just 'Danny O'Sullivan's kid'—until she cleaned them out with a straight flush. The winnings? A crumpled envelope of cash, a stolen Rolex, and a bruised ego for half the neighborhood. It was the night she learned: 'Poker ain't just about cards, sugar. It's about making them think they've already won.'",

Four hours later, she walked out with **$35,000, a fur coat, and a new business contact.** 'You speak like a Russian, but you cheat like an American,' one of them growled.
